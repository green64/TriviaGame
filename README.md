**Object**

The goal of this game is to answer the trivia questions before time runs out.

Development-wise, the jQuery training wheels are most definitely still on. But I'm Googling more efficiently, writing (a little) leaner code with jQuery and understanding the big picture a wee bit better with every mistake. Ok not every one. But it's happening.

***Technology used***

This game utilizes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. Google Fonts and a Font Awesome icon give it that je ne sais quoi that no self-respecting GoT fan will be able to resist. Function-wise it features: 
* A JavaScript-powered quiz
* A jQuery-enhanced timer
* A slide show with some jQuery goodness too
* Swearing, hand-wringing and mucho mistakes all edited out

Winter is already here. And so is my next assignment. But I'm pleased with my game, amazed at what I learned, and confident I can apply that knowledge going forward.
